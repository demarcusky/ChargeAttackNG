# SKSE Charge Attacks

SKSE plugin that implements a simple charged power attack system for Skyrim SE.

Charge attacks can only be performed from a non-crouching position with weapon drawn. This means sprinting power attacks remain the same. Combos are the same.

Charge attacks will drain stamina for as long as you hold the power attack button and should slow movement down.
Holding it longer will increase the damage of the power attack.
